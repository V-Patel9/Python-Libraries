# Python-Libraries
This is the most important feature of the NumPy library. It is the homogeneous array object. We perform all the operations on the array elements. The arrays in NumPy can be one dimensional or multidimensional. using Python NumPy and Pandas libraries (Import NumPy as np and Pandas as pd) Given the following piece of code to create a NumPy array, anIntArray: anIntArray = np.random.randint(5, 72, 48) Add Python code to convert this array into a Pandas series and then extract values stored at the positions 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 of the series. numpy.random.randint() is one of the functions for doing random sampling in numpy. it runs between the given range upto a given size. numpy.take() returns elements from an array along the mentioned indices.
